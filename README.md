# Final-Project-FE_595

The project consists on creating a web-app with Streamlit.

Streamlit is a python package that allows for creating website based to python codes.

The web-app receive as input tickers (stocks, index, ETF, traded funds), start and end dates and generate a financial analysis of the 
asset and create an optimized portfolio. 

The additional_analysis.py contains additional analysis on the portfolio and it can be run locally typing streamlit run additional_analysis.py on the terminal. It is due to issues on the package PyPortfolioOpt working on AWS.
